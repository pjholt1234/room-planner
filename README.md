# Room planner web application

I decided to combine both learning typescript, html canvas and its supporting JS API and MongoDB. The project was designed to be a room planner, heavily inspired by Canva

## Technologies
1. Typescript
2. React
3. Mongoose
4. MongoDB

## Installation
1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project
2.  Run `docker compose up` 


## Testing
- Test directories are located in  `./frontend` + `./backend` 
- Navigate to these directories and run `npm run test`
